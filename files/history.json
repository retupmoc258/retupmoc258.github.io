    "description": "My primary responsibility was to teach students mathematics and develop curriculum.  My secondary responsibilities included managing Google Workspace, Canvas LMS, and Securly.  I did this through Google Apps scripts that ran in a serverless environment.  All the data we needed was stored in a Google Sheet file and the script provided interfaces for the user to use and communicated with the various APIs of Canvas and Google when it executed to update all the systems.  I also created several small scripts that would process Google Forms in a variety of ways (including sending emails, creating a Google Doc, making Trello cards, etc.)."
